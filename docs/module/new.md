# Module - `new.js`
This module is a function used at the root of the module when required as a constructor that automatically picks supported devices and their corresponding classes. This method of construction is not required, just easy to use. You can supply `new.js` with port numbers to use if you know them or omit them for it to detect the first supported pair.
