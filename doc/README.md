# Hints
- Classes are written as `Launchpad` and instances are written as `launchpad`
- Italic arguments such as *`port` (optional)* are optional
- Arguments with the spread syntax indicate more than one is acceptable such as `...colors`.
- Methods and properties are alphabetized for the most part
- GitHub automatically adds anchors for all headers next to the header text for easy sharing and referencing

## Offline
Clone this using `Clone this wiki locally` on the sidebar and using a text editor or markdown preview. [Atom](https://atom.io/) comes with a markdown preview package that works pretty well with README.md files and wikis that can be activated with `Ctrl + Shift + M`.
